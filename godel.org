* Introduction
** Overview
\pause
*** Godel's theorem says, roughly, that there are true statements about the natural numbers which cannot be proved.\pause
*** We prove this theorem by constructing such a statement.\pause
*** Roughly speaking, "this statement is unprovable".\pause
**** If false, it can be proved to be true.\pause
**** Therefore true, therefore unprovable.\pause
*** How is this not a proof?\pause
*** How is this statement about the natural numbers?

* Peano arithmetic as a formal system
** The "MIU" game
\pause
*** Played with strings containing the symbols =M=, =I=, =U=.\pause
*** Some strings are theorems. Which?\pause
*** Derivations: making new theorems from old.\pause
**** \texttt{M$x$I} → \texttt{M$x$IU}\pause
**** \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}\pause
**** \texttt{M$x$III$y$} → \texttt{M$x$U$y$}\pause
**** \texttt{M$x$UU$y$} → \texttt{M$xy$}\pause
*** We start with a list of initial theorems ("axioms")\pause
**** The only axiom is =MI=.
** An example derivation
\pause
- \texttt{MI} \hfill axiom\pause
- \texttt{MII} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}\pause
- \texttt{MIIII} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}\pause
- \texttt{MUI} \hfill \texttt{M$x$III$y$} → \texttt{M$x$U$y$}\pause
- \texttt{MUIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$I} → \texttt{M$x$IU}\pause
- \texttt{MUIUUIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}\pause
- \texttt{MUIIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$UU$y$} → \texttt{M$xy$}
** What about nontheorems?
\pause
*** Is \texttt{MU} a theorem?\pause
*** If it is, we can prove it by producing a derivation.\pause
**** We could search derivations methodically, and eventually find MU.\pause
*** If not, how can we prove that?\pause
**** If we search for it, we'll never find it. But we'll never see that we'll never find it.\pause
**** Answer: count the number of \texttt{I}s in a theorem, modulo 3.\pause
**** This is not generalisable.
** The "Number theory" (NT) Game
\pause
*** A more complicated game that mathematicians like to play.\pause
*** Symbols: 0-9, +, ×, =, ∧, ∨, ¬, ⇒, (, ), a, b, c, $\prime$, ∀, ∃\pause
*** Some derivation rules:\pause
**** $w(x ∧ y)z$ → $w¬(¬x ∨ ¬y)z$ \hfill de Morgan's law\pause
**** $(x = y)$ → $(x+1 = y+1)$ \hfill Successorship\pause
**** $x$, $y$ → $(x ∧ y)$ \hfill Joining\pause
**** $x\{0\}$, $∀a (x\{a\} ⇒ x\{a+1\})$ → $∀a (x\{a\})$ \hfill Induction\pause
*** Axioms:\pause
**** $∀a ¬(a+1 = 0)$ \pause
**** $∀a (a+0 = a)$ \pause
**** $∀a∀b (a + (b+1) = (a+b) + 1)$ \pause
**** $∀a (a×0 = 0)$ \pause
**** $∀a∀b (a × (b+1) = (a×b) + a)$
** Is number theory complete?
\pause
*** A well-formed statement in the numer theory game is either:\pause
**** True or false;\pause
**** A theorem or nontheorem.\pause
**** If a nontheorem, its negation might be a theorem.\pause
*** We hope:\pause
**** A statement is a theorem iff it is true;\pause
**** $x$ is a theorem iff $¬x$ is a nontheorem.\pause
**** These are (kind of) equivalent.\pause
*** But incompleteness ruins this hope.
* Gödel numbering
** Gödel numbering (MIU)
\pause
*** Turn MIU-strings into numbers.\pause
*** M → 1, I → 2, U → 3\pause
*** New rules, where $x\shl{n}$ means $x\cdot 10^n$:\pause
**** $1\shl{n+1} + x\shl{1} + 2$ → $1\shl{n+2} + x\shl{2} + 23$ where $x < 1\shl{n}$ \pause
**** $1\shl{n} + x → 1\shl{2n} + x\shl{n} + x$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ \pause
**** $1\shl{m+n+3} + x\shl{m+3} + 222\shl{m} + y$ → $1\shl{m+n+1} + x\shl{m+1} + 3\shl{m} + y$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ and $y < 1\shl{m}$ \pause
**** $1\shl{m+n+2} + x\shl{m+2} + 33\shl{m} + y$ → $1\shl{m+n} + x\shl{m} + y$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ and $y < 1\shl{m}$ \pause
**** $12$ is an axiom\pause
*** So now we have derivations like:\pause
**** 12 → 122 → 12222 → 132 → 1323 → 1323323 → 13223
** Gödel numbering (number theory)
\pause
*** Can do the same thing to the number theory game, it's just a lot more complicated.\pause
*** For example, De Morgan's law: $w(x ∧ y)z$ → $w¬(¬x ∨ ¬y)z$.\pause

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\small{\[
w\shl{l+m+n+3} + \colquo{\left(\right.}\shl{l+m+n+2} + x\shl{m+n+2} + \colquo{∧}\shl{m+n+1} + y\shl{n+1} + \colquo{\left.\right)}\shl{n} + z
\]
→
\[
w\shl{l+m+n+6} + \colquo{¬\left(\right.¬}\shl{l+m+n+3} + x\shl{m+n+3} + \colquo{∨¬}\shl{m+n+1} + y\shl{n+1} + \colquo{\left.\right)}\shl{n}+z
\]}
where $z < 1\shl{n}$, $y < 1\shl{m}$, $x < 1\shl{l}$.

* Representation
** What good is this?
\pause
*** Given an MIU-string $x$, can we construct an "equivalent" NT-string $y$?\pause
**** If so, we can use number theory to talk about the MIU game.\pause
**** And if so, maybe we can do the same thing to an NT-string?\pause
**** Then we can make NT-theorems talk about NT-theorems.\pause
**** Eventually, we need a theorem to talk about itself. So this is a good first step.\pause
*** "Equivalent" means $y$ is an NT-theorem iff $x$ is an MIU-theorem.\pause
**** We want to be able to do this even if we don't know whether $x$ is an MIU-theorem.\pause
*** It turns out we can.\pause
*** Won't prove this, but will try to convince.\pause
**** Given a number $x$, we construct an NT-statement which is a theorem iff $x$ is the Gödel number of a well-formed MIU-statement.\pause
**** To be precise, iff $x$ contains only the decimal digits 1, 2, 3.
** Useful tricks
\pause
*** Check that a finite set of things each has some property.\pause
*** Finite sequences are countable.\pause
**** Can represent a sequence by a number, and use another number to extract elements from it.\pause
*** Instead of finding a number that satisfies P, just need to ask "does $x$ satisfy P?" Then use ∃.
** MIU-FORMED
\pause
*** $\text{LOG}\{a,b\}$ → $1\shl{b} > a ∧ 1\shl{b-1} ≤ a$ \pause
*** $\text{GOOD}\{a\}$ → $a = 1 ∨ a = 2 ∨ a = 3$ \pause
*** $\text{NTH}\{a,b,c\}$ tests whether the $b$'th digit of $a$ is $c$.\pause
*** $\text{MIU-FORMED}\{a\}$ →\pause

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{align*}
∃b(&\text{LOG}\{a,b\} ∧\\
   &∃(\text{sequence }x_1\text{ to }x_b) ∀c (c < b ⇒ \text{NTH}\{a,c,x_c\} ∧ \text{GOOD}\{x_c\}))
\end{align*}

** NT-THEOREM
\pause
*** If an NT-statement can be Gödel-numberised, so can an NT-derivation.\pause
*** So given the number of a derivation, and the number of a statement, we can ask\pause
 "Does this derivation prove this statement?"\pause
*** This can be expressed as an NT-statement, $\text{NT-DERIVES}\{a,b\}$.\pause
*** So we can construct:\pause
$\text{NT-THEOREM}\{a\}$ → $∃b (\text{NT-DERIVES}\{b,a\})$.\pause
*** Note that constructing a statement is much easier than determining its truth.
* "This statement is unprovable"
** Self-reference
\pause
*** Liar paradox: "This statement is true."\pause
*** Not much better: P - "Q is true." Q - "P is false."\pause
*** Quine:
"yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation." yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation.\pause
**** This turns out to be the key.
** Quining
\pause
*** If an NT-statement has free variables, we can substitute any number we like into them.\pause
*** In particular, we can substitute the Gödel number of the original statement.\pause
*** Construct a formula $\text{QUINE}\{a,b\}$ which tests whether $b$ is "$a$ quined".\pause
**** Essentially, $\text{QUINE}\{a,b\}$ → $b = a\{a\}$
** "This statement is unprovable"
\pause
*** Let $U\{a\}$ → $¬∃b (\text{QUINE}\{a,b\} ∧ \text{NT-THEOREM}\{b\})$ \pause
*** Let $G$ be the quinification of $U$.\pause
*** In other words, find $G$ such that $\text{QUINE}\{U,G\}$ is true.\pause
*** $U\{a\}$ says "$a$ quined is not a theorem." Equivalently, "is not provable."\pause
*** So $G$ (= $U\{U\}$) says "$U$ quined is not provable."\pause
*** But $G$ \emph{is} $U$ quined.\pause
*** Thus, $G$ says "$G$ is not provable."
** Aftermath
\pause
*** If $G$ is false, we can find a proof of $G$, and number theory is inconsistent.\pause
*** If $G$ is true, it can't be proved, so number theory is incomplete.\pause
*** Since $¬G$ says "$G$ is provable", $¬G$ asserts its own negation.\pause
*** So neither $G$ nor $¬G$ is a theorem.
