These are the slides for a talk I gave outlining a proof of Gödel's
incompleteness theorem. The proof is based on the one given in "Gödel, Escher,
Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid", but annoyingly I forgot to mention that in the
talk or the slides.

The master file is godel.org, which works with emacs' org-mode and the LaTeX
beamer class. That gets compiled to the .tex, which gets compiled to the .pdf.

The -nopause versions are the same, but display each slide all at once, instead
of one bullet point at a time.

To download the pdfs, you can click on them, and then click 'view raw'.
