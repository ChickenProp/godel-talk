* Introduction
** Overview
*** Godel's theorem says, roughly, that there are true statements about the natural numbers which cannot be proved.
*** We prove this theorem by constructing such a statement.
*** Roughly speaking, "this statement is unprovable".
**** If false, it can be proved to be true.
**** Therefore true, therefore unprovable.
*** How is this not a proof?
*** How is this statement about the natural numbers?

* Peano arithmetic as a formal system
** The "MIU" game
*** Played with strings containing the symbols =M=, =I=, =U=.
*** Some strings are theorems. Which?
*** Derivations: making new theorems from old.
**** \texttt{M$x$I} → \texttt{M$x$IU}
**** \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}
**** \texttt{M$x$III$y$} → \texttt{M$x$U$y$}
**** \texttt{M$x$UU$y$} → \texttt{M$xy$}
*** We start with a list of initial theorems ("axioms")
**** The only axiom is =MI=.
** An example derivation
- \texttt{MI} \hfill axiom
- \texttt{MII} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}
- \texttt{MIIII} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}
- \texttt{MUI} \hfill \texttt{M$x$III$y$} → \texttt{M$x$U$y$}
- \texttt{MUIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$I} → \texttt{M$x$IU}
- \texttt{MUIUUIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$} → \texttt{M$xx$}
- \texttt{MUIIU} \hfill \texttt{M$x$UU$y$} → \texttt{M$xy$}
** What about nontheorems?
*** Is \texttt{MU} a theorem?
*** If it is, we can prove it by producing a derivation.
**** We could search derivations methodically, and eventually find MU.
*** If not, how can we prove that?
**** If we search for it, we'll never find it. But we'll never see that we'll never find it.
**** Answer: count the number of \texttt{I}s in a theorem, modulo 3.
**** This is not generalisable.
** The "Number theory" (NT) Game
*** A more complicated game that mathematicians like to play.
*** Symbols: 0-9, +, ×, =, ∧, ∨, ¬, ⇒, (, ), a, b, c, $\prime$, ∀, ∃
*** Some derivation rules:
**** $w(x ∧ y)z$ → $w¬(¬x ∨ ¬y)z$ \hfill de Morgan's law
**** $(x = y)$ → $(x+1 = y+1)$ \hfill Successorship
**** $x$, $y$ → $(x ∧ y)$ \hfill Joining
**** $x\{0\}$, $∀a (x\{a\} ⇒ x\{a+1\})$ → $∀a (x\{a\})$ \hfill Induction
*** Axioms:
**** $∀a ¬(a+1 = 0)$ 
**** $∀a (a+0 = a)$ 
**** $∀a∀b (a + (b+1) = (a+b) + 1)$ 
**** $∀a (a×0 = 0)$ 
**** $∀a∀b (a × (b+1) = (a×b) + a)$
** Is number theory complete?
*** A well-formed statement in the numer theory game is either:
**** True or false;
**** A theorem or nontheorem.
**** If a nontheorem, its negation might be a theorem.
*** We hope:
**** A statement is a theorem iff it is true;
**** $x$ is a theorem iff $¬x$ is a nontheorem.
**** These are (kind of) equivalent.
*** But incompleteness ruins this hope.
* Gödel numbering
** Gödel numbering (MIU)
*** Turn MIU-strings into numbers.
*** M → 1, I → 2, U → 3
*** New rules, where $x\shl{n}$ means $x\cdot 10^n$:
**** $1\shl{n+1} + x\shl{1} + 2$ → $1\shl{n+2} + x\shl{2} + 23$ where $x < 1\shl{n}$ 
**** $1\shl{n} + x → 1\shl{2n} + x\shl{n} + x$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ 
**** $1\shl{m+n+3} + x\shl{m+3} + 222\shl{m} + y$ → $1\shl{m+n+1} + x\shl{m+1} + 3\shl{m} + y$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ and $y < 1\shl{m}$ 
**** $1\shl{m+n+2} + x\shl{m+2} + 33\shl{m} + y$ → $1\shl{m+n} + x\shl{m} + y$, where $x < 1\shl{n}$ and $y < 1\shl{m}$ 
**** $12$ is an axiom
*** So now we have derivations like:
**** 12 → 122 → 12222 → 132 → 1323 → 1323323 → 13223
** Gödel numbering (number theory)
*** Can do the same thing to the number theory game, it's just a lot more complicated.
*** For example, De Morgan's law: $w(x ∧ y)z$ → $w¬(¬x ∨ ¬y)z$.

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\small{\[
w\shl{l+m+n+3} + \colquo{\left(\right.}\shl{l+m+n+2} + x\shl{m+n+2} + \colquo{∧}\shl{m+n+1} + y\shl{n+1} + \colquo{\left.\right)}\shl{n} + z
\]
→
\[
w\shl{l+m+n+6} + \colquo{¬\left(\right.¬}\shl{l+m+n+3} + x\shl{m+n+3} + \colquo{∨¬}\shl{m+n+1} + y\shl{n+1} + \colquo{\left.\right)}\shl{n}+z
\]}
where $z < 1\shl{n}$, $y < 1\shl{m}$, $x < 1\shl{l}$.

* Representation
** What good is this?
*** Given an MIU-string $x$, can we construct an "equivalent" NT-string $y$?
**** If so, we can use number theory to talk about the MIU game.
**** And if so, maybe we can do the same thing to an NT-string?
**** Then we can make NT-theorems talk about NT-theorems.
**** Eventually, we need a theorem to talk about itself. So this is a good first step.
*** "Equivalent" means $y$ is an NT-theorem iff $x$ is an MIU-theorem.
**** We want to be able to do this even if we don't know whether $x$ is an MIU-theorem.
*** It turns out we can.
*** Won't prove this, but will try to convince.
**** Given a number $x$, we construct an NT-statement which is a theorem iff $x$ is the Gödel number of a well-formed MIU-statement.
**** To be precise, iff $x$ contains only the decimal digits 1, 2, 3.
** Useful tricks
*** Check that a finite set of things each has some property.
*** Finite sequences are countable.
**** Can represent a sequence by a number, and use another number to extract elements from it.
*** Instead of finding a number that satisfies P, just need to ask "does $x$ satisfy P?" Then use ∃.
** MIU-FORMED
*** $\text{LOG}\{a,b\}$ → $1\shl{b} > a ∧ 1\shl{b-1} ≤ a$ 
*** $\text{GOOD}\{a\}$ → $a = 1 ∨ a = 2 ∨ a = 3$ 
*** $\text{NTH}\{a,b,c\}$ tests whether the $b$'th digit of $a$ is $c$.
*** $\text{MIU-FORMED}\{a\}$ →

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{align*}
∃b(&\text{LOG}\{a,b\} ∧\\
   &∃(\text{sequence }x_1\text{ to }x_b) ∀c (c < b ⇒ \text{NTH}\{a,c,x_c\} ∧ \text{GOOD}\{x_c\}))
\end{align*}
#+END_LaTeX
** NT-THEOREM
*** If an NT-statement can be Gödel-numberised, so can an NT-derivation.
*** So given the number of a derivation, and the number of a statement, we can ask
 "Does this derivation prove this statement?"
*** This can be expressed as an NT-statement, $\text{NT-DERIVES}\{a,b\}$.
*** So we can construct:
$\text{NT-THEOREM}\{a\}$ → $∃b (\text{NT-DERIVES}\{b,a\})$.
*** Note that constructing a statement is much easier than determining its truth.
* "This statement is unprovable"
** Self-reference
*** Liar paradox: "This statement is true."
*** Not much better: P - "Q is true." Q - "P is false."
*** Quine:
"yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation." yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation.
**** This turns out to be the key.
** Quining
*** If an NT-statement has free variables, we can substitute any number we like into them.
*** In particular, we can substitute the Gödel number of the original statement.
*** Construct a formula $\text{QUINE}\{a,b\}$ which tests whether $b$ is "$a$ quined".
**** Essentially, $\text{QUINE}\{a,b\}$ → $b = a\{a\}$
** "This statement is unprovable"
*** Let $U\{a\}$ → $¬∃b (\text{QUINE}\{a,b\} ∧ \text{NT-THEOREM}\{b\})$ 
*** Let $G$ be the quinification of $U$.
*** In other words, find $G$ such that $\text{QUINE}\{U,G\}$ is true.
*** $U\{a\}$ says "$a$ quined is not a theorem." Equivalently, "is not provable."
*** So $G$ (= $U\{U\}$) says "$U$ quined is not provable."
*** But $G$ \emph{is} $U$ quined.
*** Thus, $G$ says "$G$ is not provable."
** Aftermath
*** If $G$ is false, we can find a proof of $G$, and number theory is inconsistent.
*** If $G$ is true, it can't be proved, so number theory is incomplete.
*** Since $¬G$ says "$G$ is provable", $¬G$ asserts its own negation.
*** So neither $G$ nor $¬G$ is a theorem.
